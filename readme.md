A small python program to remind you of your bedtime by turning off your computer after a countdown runs out.

I tend to get stuck in social vr games waaaayyy past my bedtime so i thouoght i'd fix that with a little program.
Since I can imagine I'm not the only one with this problem I thought I'd publush it here. 
Maybe it can help someone :)

It features: 
- a simple tkinter gui (I know it's ugly) with a countdown
- buttons to select a time from [4h,3h,2h,1h,45m,30m] 
- the ability mute and unmute the audio reminders at 30m, 15m, 5m aswell as the countdown at 10 seconds.

Installation:

1. download the .zip file

2. make sure you have python 3.11 and pip3 installed

	this will install the needed libraries
